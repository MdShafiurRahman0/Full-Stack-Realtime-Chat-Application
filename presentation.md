m### **Slide 1: Title Slide**

- **Title:** Node.js & MySQL: Full-Stack Authentication & Chat
- **Subtitle:** A Secure Foundation for Modern Web Applications
- **(Your Name/Team Name)**

---

### **Slide 2: Introduction**

- **Heading:** What is this project?
- **Content:** A robust and secure template for a full-stack web application. It features a complete user authentication system using Node.js, Express, and MySQL. It also includes a real-time chat application built with Socket.IO. This project is designed to be a solid starting point for any application that requires user accounts and real-time communication.

### **Slide 3: Key Features**

- **Heading:** Core Features
- **Content:**
  - **Secure User Registration:** Passwords are automatically hashed with `bcryptjs`.
  - **JWT-Based Authentication:** Uses JSON Web Tokens for secure, stateless sessions.
  - **Persistent Sessions:** Cookies keep users logged in between visits.
  - **Protected Routes:** Easily restrict access to pages and APIs for authenticated users only.
  - **Real-time Chat:** A live chat room powered by Socket.IO.
  - **Scalable Project Structure:** A clean separation of client and server code.

### **Slide 4: Technology Stack**

- **Heading:** Technologies Used
- **Content:**
  - **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
  - **Database:** MySQL
  - **Real-time:** Socket.IO
  - **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT), bcryptjs
  - **Frontend:** Handlebars (HBS) for server-side rendering.

### **Slide 5: Architecture**

- **Heading:** How It Works
- **Content:**
  - **Client-Server Model:** The application is split into a `client` (frontend) and `server` (backend).
  - **Frontend:** The `client` directory contains Handlebars templates for the UI and static assets like CSS and JavaScript.
  - **Backend:** The `server` directory holds the Express application, API routes, controllers for business logic, and database configuration.
  - **Database:** A MySQL database stores user information, including hashed passwords.
  - **Real-time Communication:** Socket.IO is integrated with the Node.js server to enable real-time, bidirectional communication for the chat feature.

### **Slide 6: Authentication Flow**

- **Heading:** User Authentication
- **Content:**
  1.  **Register:** A new user signs up, and their password is
      hashed before being saved to the database.
  2.  **Login:** The user logs in with their email and password.
  3.  **JWT Creation:** The server verifies the credentials and creates a secure JSON Web Token (JWT).
  4.  **Cookie Storage:** The JWT is stored in a cookie in the user's browser.
  5.  **Authenticated Requests:** For subsequent requests, the JWT is sent to the server, which verifies it to grant access to protected routes.
